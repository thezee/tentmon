Grow Tent Monitoring System for indoor gardening.

This system is being designed with growing plants indoors that require special monitoring to ensure proper growth. In it's simplest form, it will log sensor data to a centralized location for further processing for analytical and reporting purposes as well as to assist in management of plant life cycles.

Warning: I'm new to programming and python in particular, so there is absolutely no gurantees that what I have here is the best or even functional at times. This is more for my own education than anything else.
